Genetic Algorithm for Passcode Guessing
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to efficiently discover a 32-bit binary passcode. The algorithm mimics natural selection processes, including initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation. Key features include parameter tuning, real-time visualization of convergence rates, and performance metrics such as runtime and generations required to find the target passcode.

Features:
Customizable Parameters: Adjust population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate.
Visualization: Dynamic convergence chart to track fitness improvements over generations.
Performance Metrics: Tracks runtime and generations to achieve the target.
JavaScript Implementation: Lightweight, browser-friendly solution.
Technologies Used:
JavaScript (Algorithm Logic)
Chart.js (Data Visualization)
HTML/CSS (User Interface)
This project demonstrates the power of evolutionary algorithms for optimization problems and serves as a foundation for further exploration in artificial intelligence and computational problem-solving.
