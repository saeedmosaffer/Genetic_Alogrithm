# Genetic Algorithm for Passcode Guessing

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm** in JavaScript to efficiently discover a 32-bit binary passcode using natural selection techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation. It features real-time visualization of convergence rates, customizable parameters, and performance tracking, highlighting the power of evolutionary algorithms in solving optimization problems.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic convergence chart to monitor fitness improvements over generations.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks runtime and generations to achieve the target passcode.
- **JavaScript Implementation**: Lightweight and browser-friendly solution.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the Genetic Algorithm logic.
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface.

This project demonstrates the efficiency and flexibility of Genetic Algorithms and provides a foundation for exploring advanced optimization techniques in AI and computational problem-solving.
